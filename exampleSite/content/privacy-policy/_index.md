**A Conversation About Circumcision**

**_I hear cut is cleaner._**

Not from someone with a foreskin. That's like saying having no ears is cleaner. Crazy. Think about it, the only clean penis is a washed penis. Foreskin takes approximately 0 seconds more to clean- _and it feels **soooooo** good._

**_But it traps germs and junk under the skin doesn't it?_**

Ummm, no. That's not how it works. Your eyelids don't trap germs and junk under them do they? In adults the foreskin protects the glans just like your eyelid protects your eye. The foreskin actually creates an antibacterial and antiviral environment for the head while a cut penis is constantly rubbing against the scrotum and thighs where bacteria can start colonizing in the urethra. In babies, the foreskin is fused to the head like your fingernail is to your finger (and they both hurt like hell when pulled apart). I assume you haven't had your nails pulled off? Or your eyelids cut off? Because that would make more sense since you need to daily wash the sleep from your eyes and wash your fingers.

**_I thought circumcision prevented UTIs and AIDS and other diseases?_**

No. Cut men get both.

**_I mean cut guys are a lot less likely to get infected._**

There have been many studies trying to find a medical justification for this extremely profitable and a quick surgery. And indeed, many have claimed a benefit. However, most if not all have had fundamental biases in favor of circumcision but **none** have had any statistically verifiable benefits. That is, the data doesn't show that circumcision had any benefit. Even if they did have the claimed benefits- and again there is no statistical evidence that they do- amputation would not be justified to treat the diseases let alone prevent them when they're so rare and the risks of circumcision are considerably more common and severe. Fact is a guy will need a condom whether or not he's cut and it's idiotically reckless to think circumcision will cut it (pardon the pun). And most guys will never get a UTI. If he does, we have something called antibiotics for that- no penis removal necessary (you barbarian).

**_Yeah, but women prefer cut._**

Actually most women don't. And women that prefer cut babies are perverts.

**_I meant adults._**

If your partner wants you to have less genitals and subsequently less pleasure, you should look for a new partner. But if your son really loves that freak, he can always cut some penis off. In the more likely scenario where they'd both prefer a whole penis and you circumcised him, there's no choice when you've taken it from him.

**_Isn't it more painful when you're grown up?_**

A man can handle more pain than a baby. Especially when he can have anesthesia and a baby gets his genitals carved up with only a little Tylenol and sugar water at most.

**_But if he's going to get it done anyway, I'm sure he'd rather it happened as a baby._**

If he's left intact, he's not going to want to get circumcised. Just ask any intact man. Fact is, most men are uncircumcised because they have no desire to be circumcised just like I'm sure you don't want to be circumcised. It probably seems crazy to you for a woman to want to get circumcised just like it would seem crazy to an intact man for another man to want to get circumcised.

**_But it doesn't matter because he won't remember._**

Tell me about how it's not rape if she's passed out.

**_But, the looks!_**

I know, mutilated is gross, right?

**_No, I mean I prefer cut._**

Yeah, but it's not your penis. You might prefer penis piercings too but it doesn't mean you should give your baby one.

**_It doesn't really matter, does it?_**

Every baby experiences excruciating pain, to the point where many will disassociate as if they weren't even there because they can't handle the pain. For the rest of his life he will be robbed of all the pleasure a foreskin is capable of bringing (which is more than any other part) and he will never get to experience what natural sex is like. Is robbing him of that worth so much to you that you'd rob him of the right to chose for himself whether he wants to be circumcised or whole? How would you feel if he hated being circumcised when he grew up and he couldn't do anything about it? How would you feel if he needed corrective surgery, either as a baby or as an adult, which is not uncommon? Could you live with yourself in the very rare occurrence where your baby died from blood loss all because you wanted him to have a needless cosmetic surgery?

**_I'm going to do what I want to do._**

Humans have the right to bodily integrity; no one- **no one-** has the right to sterlize you against your will, or throw acid in your face, or lop off your body parts. Not your government, not a misogynist, and not your parents. You get to chose to be a monster but you're going to have to live with the consequences- the bloody diapers, the hurt baby and a who knows what else, from an angry young man still suffering the consequences to a dead baby. Do you want to be that kind of person and live with that?
