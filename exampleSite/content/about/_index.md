description: Foreskin Function and Circumcision Traditions

**A Brief Synopsis:**

Many men are very sensitive about their penis. They worry that it is too short or that is too long, that it is crooked or that it is ugly, that it is too skinny or too small flaccid. This being the case, many can't handle dealing with the idea that it is inadequate, that it is less of a penis because there is literally less of the penis. The lie that less is more becomes very attractive. They want to believe that missing a functional and sensitive part of the penis is somehow better than having all of their penis. It becomes unbearable to think that they were subjected to an enormous amount of pain for no reason other than the ill-considered whim of their parents. They can either believe that they were effectively raped as babies by those who above all others should have protected them and that they bear a loss to this day and that the most emotionally and sexually important organ of theirs is unquestionably worse than it should have been. It's much more appealing to believe that their penis was made cleaner and better looking and somehow a whole, fully-functional penis is gross and dirty. The outrage an intact man would have if someone mutilated his body becomes the outrage these men have for the idea that they shouldn't have been mutilated and that they should get to choose what happens to their body. And thus bad becomes good and good becomes bad and the victims become the victimizers.  
Foreskin is not merely a flap of skin just as your ear is not a flap of skin. Even if it was 'just" skin, what skin do you wish had been removed from you at birth? The foreskin has shaft skin on the outside that is just as sensitive, and the skin on the inside is like the inside of your mouth. The tip of the foreskin has a band that keeps it bunched up on the head of the penis (an internal sense organ). In this way, it is very much like the tongue - an internal sense organ that is kept moist. Foreskin provides a protective and cleaning role very much like an eyelid does for an eye. A dried-out eye does not work very well. A dried-out glans does not work for well, especially when the constant rubbing against it calluses the organ. The foreskin is not only very sensitive itself, but it slides along the shaft and head of the penis and feels fantastic. It feels incomparably better which any intact man can confirm. He no doubt uses his foreskin to masturbate rather than holding it back and using his lubricated hand against his shaft and glans. The foreskin avoids any need for lubrication. This means sex for the woman is much more comfortable. She can feel the foreskin as well during sex obviating the need for a ribbed condom. Rather than trapping infections, smegma, or stink, the foreskin protects the head of the penis from getting anything on it- like poop in a diaper or bacteria from the scrotum or thighs. It is antibacterial and antiviral and keeps the head of the penis soft and supple and sensitive.  
Circumcision is a tradition. There have been several studies by those in the medical field looking for a medical benefit to this procedure that generates enormous amounts of money for medical practitioners. They have all been of inexcusably poor quality. An accurate statistical analysis of all the data generated by them has failed to show any advantage to circumcision. Even if all suggested advantages were true, they still wouldn't medically warrant circumcision and its risks when there are enormously more successful options available, such as antibiotics and condoms which are cheap and easy to use and incomparably more effective. {The (under)reported complications exceed the (exaggerated) purported benefits.}  
Most importantly, it is absolutely unethical to subject someone against his will to a medical procedure he does not need. It is unethical to remove the breast tissue from a baby girl in some attempt to lessen the likelihood that she would develop breast cancer later in life. It is unethical to remove some of the genitals of a baby girl because it is the cultural preference of men and women. It is unethical to remove some of the genitals of a baby boy because of the cultural preference of men and women. If you subject your preferences- especially when they are sexual- onto someone else's body without his consent, it is called rape. Routine infant circumcision is a human rights violation first and foremost. Each human has the right to bodily integrity and this right is not superseded by the pre-supposed rights of anyone else- whether it be a parent or state- to inflict your traditions or sexual preferences by violence onto the body of another person.  
If circumcision doesnâ€™t seem like senseless violence to you, then watch a circumcision of a baby and talk to an intact man.
